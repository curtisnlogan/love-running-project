# Love Running Website

This project was a significant learning experience. While following the core curriculum, many aspects required deep-dives into documentation and online resources to solve specific challenges. Key learning takeaways include:

* **Flexbox:** Extensive use of CSS Flexbox for creating robust and responsive layouts.
* **Semantic HTML:** A strong focus on using semantic HTML5 tags for better structure, accessibility, and SEO.
* **Git & GitHub Workflow:** Practiced a professional version control workflow, including:
    * Making small, atomic commits with clear, conventional commit messages.
    * Using branches for the first-time, as different parts of the website were built.
