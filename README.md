[**View Live Project**](https://curtisnlogan.github.io/love-running/)  

Welcome to the Love Running project repository. This website was developed as part of the Code Institute's Full-Stack Software Developer program. It serves as a fictional running club's informational site, featuring a home page, a gallery, and a signup form.

## Development & Learning Journey

This project was a significant learning experience. While following the core curriculum, many aspects required deep-dives into documentation and online resources to solve specific challenges. Key learning takeaways include:

* **Flexbox:** Extensive use of CSS Flexbox for creating robust and responsive layouts.
* **Semantic HTML:** A strong focus on using semantic HTML5 tags for better structure, accessibility, and SEO.
* **Git & GitHub Workflow:** Practiced a professional version control workflow, including:
    * Making small, atomic commits with clear, conventional commit messages.
    * Using branches for the first-time, as different parts of the website were built
* **Problem-Solving:** Independently researching and implementing solutions for styling and layout challenges that went beyond the guided tutorials.
